Problem 1a:

Python program that takes the user's first name and last name as input and then calls a fullname function to concatenate them into a full name,it will prompt the user for their first name and last name, then display the full name by calling the fullname function.

Problem 1b:

creating a string_alternative function in Python to return every other character in a given string,This code defines a string_alternative function that iterates through the input string with a step of 2, effectively selecting every other character in the string

Problem 2:

To count the word frequency in a text file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output, including the word count, and store the results in an output.txt file,this program works by defining a function count_words that takes a line, converts it to lowercase, and uses a regular expression (\w+) to find words within the line.creates a dictionary word_count_dict to store word frequencies.and opening the input file (input.txt) and the output file (output.txt).For each line in the input file, it strips any leading/trailing whitespace, counts the words using the count_words function, and writes the original line and word count header to the output file and updating the word count dictionary with the counts for each word.After processing all lines the program writes the word count for each word to the output file.

Problem 3a:

The purpose of this program is to convert the value of heights given in a list form inches to centimeters using interactive loop method
This method uses a nested interactive loop to read heights in inches and convert them to centimeters, storing them in separate lists.

Problem 3b:

The purpose of this program is to convert the value of heights given in a list form inches to centimeters using list comprehension, this method used buil-in list functions to convert the list values
