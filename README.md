Assignment 1 

 

Question1: 

                        

This problem requires us to get an input from console as python and delete at least 2 letters and output the rest as a reversed string. So i first assign a variable "a" and get input from the user and set another variable "b" as python just to make sure the user entered the correct string then i use the replace() function to replace two letters in the string and use the extended slice function where the -1 in the step indicates that the string starts from the end and stops at the beginning thus reversing the string and printing the output. 

Question 1b: 

               

This problem simply asks us to get two numbers and perform 4 arithmetic operations on them, so i choose 2 numbers as input "a" and "b" and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them and print their respective outputs. 

Question 2: 

              

This problem asks us to take an input from the user and replace any "python" present in the sentence to "pythons", so I just use the simple replace () function to replace the "python" from the input to "pythons". 

Question 3: 

             

This problem asks us to get class grade as an input and give out the grades as output using if else statements, so i use the variable "class_score" to get the input from the user and construct an if else ladder so that the appropriate grades are displayed as outputs.
